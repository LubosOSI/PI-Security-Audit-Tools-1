PISYSAUDIT
        
SHORT DESCRIPTION
The PI Security Audit Tools are a set of scripts that perform a set of 
security validations.

LONG DESCRIPTION
This project is a framework to baseline the security configuration of your PI 
System. This tool framework is built as a PowerShell module containing cmdlets 
to perform different calls to collect the data from the security settings of 
different requested PI System components.

A series of PowerShell script files (*.psm1) form a single module named PI 
System Audit Module (or PISysAudit Module) once loaded. You will find one core 
script containing the collection logic and four library scripts containing the
validation logic for different topics such as best practices to harden the 
machine, PI Data Archive, etc. The module exposes several cmdlets either used 
for the internal logic or the external interface with the end-user.	

VALIDATION CHECKS AND COMPLIANCE CONDITIONS
	
//BEGINSECTION - VALIDATIONS// This section is automatically generated.

AU10001 - Domain Membership
VALIDATION: Verifies that the machine is a member of an Active Directory 
Domain.  
COMPLIANCE: Join the machine to an Active Directory Domain. Use of a domain is 
encouraged as AD provides Kerberos authentication and is our best available 
technology for securing a PI System. Furthermore, the implementation of 
transport security in the PI System relies on Windows Integrated Security and 
AD to automatically enable higher strength ciphers.

AU10002 - Operating System Installation Type
VALIDATION: Verifies that the OS installation type is server core for the 
reduced surface area.
COMPLIANCE: The operating system installation type should be Server Core. This 
check is rated as a critical severity because as an application, PI can only be 
as secure as the platform it runs on. Server core provides a dramatically 
reduced software footprint compared to the standard server installation with 
all graphic components. Fewer application running and fewer services 
communicating over the network amount to a reduced attack surface area overall. 
The critical severity rating is intended to reflect our stance that if an 
administrator were to only implement one change, switching to server core would 
have the greatest impact.
For more on the advantages of Windows Server Core, please see:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846314(v=vs.85).aspx 

AU10003 - Windows Firewall Enabled
VALIDATION: Verifies that the Windows host based firewall is enabled. 
COMPLIANCE: Enable the Windows firewall for Domain, Private and Public Scope.  
A firewall's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the configuration. For PI-
specific port requirements, please see: 
https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB01162  
For more general information on the Windows firewall, see "Windows Firewall 
with Advanced Security Overview" on TechNet: 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831365(v=ws.11).aspx 

AU10004 - AppLocker Enabled
VALIDATION: Verifies that AppLocker is enabled.   
COMPLIANCE: Set AppLocker to Enforce mode after establishing a policy and ensure
that the Application Identity service is not disabled.  For a primer on running 
AppLocker on a PI Data Archive, see: 
https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00994

AU10005 - UAC Enabled
VALIDATION: Verifies that UAC is enabled.  More precisely, it verifies the 
following default features: EnableLUA, ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin, 
EnableInstallerDetection, PromptOnSecureDesktop and EnableSecureUIAPaths.
Additionally, a check is performed for the feature ValidateAdminCodeSignatures.  
Lower severity is assigned if this is the only feature disabled.
COMPLIANCE: Enable the flagged UAC features through Local Security Policy. For 
more information on specific UAC features, see: 
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835564(v=ws.10).aspx 

AU10006 - Health Monitoring (OSIsoft NOC)
VALIDATION: Checks if PI Diagnostics and PI Agent are installed and enabled, 
indicating that the machine is monitored in the OSIsoft NOC. 
COMPLIANCE: The goal of this check is to ensure that the PI System component
has monitoring for notification and response, of which mPI is one example. If 
an equivalent independent solution is in place for monitoring, this check can
be safely ignored.  To ensure compliance with this check PI Agent and PI 
Diagnostics need to be installed and running on the machine so that the OSIsoft 
NOC will detect issues. 

AU10007 - Internet Explorer Enhanced Security
VERIFICATION: Validates that IE Enhanced Security is enabled 
COMPLIANCE: Ensure that Internet Explorer Enhanced Security is enabled for both
Administrators and Users. More information is available at:
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd883248(v=ws.10).aspx  

AU10008 - Software Updates
VERIFICATION: Validates that the operating system and Microsoft applications 
receive updates 
COMPLIANCE: Ensure that the operating system and the Microsoft applications
have been updated in the last 120 days.
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/311047/how-to-keep-your-windows-computer-up-to-date 

AU10009 - No Internet Access
VERIFICATION: Checks that this server is not able to access the internet.
COMPLIANCE: Implement firewall restrictions to prevent access to the internet 
from the server.

AU20001 - PI Data Archive Table Security
VALIDATION: Examines the database security of the PI Data Archive and flags 
any ACLs that contain access for PIWorld as weak. 
COMPLIANCE: Remove PIWorld access from all database security ACLs.  Note that 
prior to removing PIWorld access, you need to evaluate which applications are 
relying on that access so that you can grant those applications access 
explicitly.  This check will also pass if PIWorld is disabled globally.

AU20002 - PI Admin Usage
VALIDATION: Verifies that the piadmin PI User is not used in mappings or trusts.
COMPLIANCE: Replace any trusts or mappings that use piadmin with a mapping or 
trust to a PI Identity with appropriate privilege for the applications that will
use it.  Will also check if trusts and mappings to piadmin have been disabled 
globally.  This can be done by checking "User cannot be used in a Trust" and 
"User cannot be used in a Mapping" in the Properties menu for the piadmin PI 
User.  To access this menu open use the Identities, Users, & Groups plugin in 
PI SMT, navigate to the PI User tab, right click the piadmin entry and select 
Properties in the context menu. For more information, see "Security Best 
Practice" #4 in KB00833: 
https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00833

Associated security bulletins:
https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Products/PI-Server/PI-Data-Archive/Alerts

AU20004 - Edit Days Specified
VALIDATION: verified that the Edit Days tuning parameter is set. 
COMPLIANCE: set to a value greater than zero.  EditDays defines the number of 
past days where events can be modified in the Snapshot or Archive databases. A 
zero value means no time check is done.  For instructions to set EditDays, see 
"Modify the EditDays tuning parameter" section in the PI Data Archive System 
Management Guide:
https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v10/GUID-0865CC31-BF8C-4347-B717-15071ED51399 

AU20005 - Auto Trust Configuration
VALIDATION: Verifies that the autotrustconfig tuning parameter is set to create 
either no trusts or a trust for the loopback automatically (127.0.0.1). 
COMPLIANCE: Set the autotrustconfig tuning parameter to a value of 0 (do not 
automatically create any PI Trust entries) or 1 (create the trust entry for the 
loopback IP address 127.0.0.1 only).

AU20006 - Expensive Query Protection
VALIDATION: Verify that the PI Data Archive has protection against expensive 
queries. 
COMPLIANCE: Set the archive_maxqueryexecutionsec tuning parameter to a value 
between 60 and 300.  For more information on this parameter and other that can 
protect against expensive queries, see the knowledgebase article 3224OSI8: 
https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/3224OSI8  

AU20007 - Explicit Login Disabled
VALIDATION: Verifies that explicit login is disabled as an authentication
protocol.   
COMPLIANCE: Set the tuning parameter Server_AuthenticationPolicy to a value 
greater than 3. This is equivalent to the third notch, "Disable explicit login", 
or higher on the Security Settings plugin in PI SMT.  For more information, see 
"Security Best Practice #2" and "Security Best Practice #3" in KB00833. 
https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00833 

AU20008 - PI Server SPN
VALIDATION: Checks PI Data Archive SPN assignment.
COMPLIANCE: PI Data Archive SPNs exist and are assigned to the account running 
pinetmgr. Presently only local system is supported.  Correct SPN assignment 
makes Kerberos Authentication possible.  For more information, see "PI and 
Kerberos authentication" in the PI Live Library. 
https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v10/GUID-531FFEC4-9BBB-4CA0-9CE7-7434B21EA06D 

AU20009 - PI Collective
VALIDATION: Checks if the PI Data Archive is a member of a High Availability 
Collective. 
COMPLIANCE: Ensure that the PI Data Archive is a member of a PI Collective to 
allow for High Availability which avoids a single point of failure and allows 
for less disruptive servicing.

AU20010 - No Client Software
VALIDATION: Checks if common client software is installed on the PI Data Archive
machine. 
COMPLIANCE: Local logon access to the PI Data Archive server should be limited to
administrators and only performed for maintenance tasks which require local 
logon. Client tools should not be necessary locally, and following the principle 
of least functionality, should be removed to reduce the available attack surface
and required patch maintenance. As a minimum measure, ensure common client tools 
such as PI ProcessBook and Microsoft Office are not installed on the PI Data
Archive machines. 

AU20011 - PI Firewall Used
VALIDATION: Checks that PI Firewall is used. 
COMPLIANCE: The default PI Firewall rule of "Allow *.*.*.*" should be removed 
and replaced with specific IPs or subnets that may connect to the PI Data 
Archive. For more information on PI Firewall, see: 
https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v10/GUID-14FC1696-D64B-49B0-96ED-6EEF3CE92DCB  

AU20013 - PI Backup Configured
VALIDATION: Ensures that PI Backups are configured and current. 
COMPLIANCE: Configure PI Backup to back up PI Data Archive configuration and 
data daily. Ad hoc backups with PI SMT or with the pibackup.bat script with 
type COPY will register as not compliant because they do not update the 
LastBackupTime attribute, and will not be detected. Incremental backups as
installed by pibackup.bat update the LastBackupTime. It is best practice to 
back up to a local disk on the PI Data Archive machine, then copy the backup 
to an off-machine location. For more information, see:
https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v10/GUID-8F56FDA9-505C-4868-8483-E51435E80A61

NT Service\PINetMgr with PI Data Archive version greater than 2017 R2.

AU30001 - PI AF Server Service Account
VALIDATION: Verifies that the AF Server application service is not running as 
the account Local System. 
COMPLIANCE: Run the AF Server Application service as a user other than Local 
System.  In order to change the user that the service is running as, open 
control panel, go to Programs, Programs and Features, select the entry for the 
PI AF Server and click Change.  This will launch the installer where you will 
be given the option to change configuration settings, including the service 
account.

AU30002 - Impersonation mode for AF Data Sets
VALIDATION: Verifies the impersonation mode for external data tables. 
COMPLIANCE: Set the Configuration Setting 
ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers to false, thereby requiring 
impersonation for access to external tables.  This setting can be changed by
