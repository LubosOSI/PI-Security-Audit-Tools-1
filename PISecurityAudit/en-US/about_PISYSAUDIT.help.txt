SHORT DESCRIPTION
        The PI Security Audit Tools are a set of scripts that perform a set of security
	validations.

LONG DESCRIPTION
        This project is a framework to baseline the security configuration of your PI System. 
	This tool framework is built as a PowerShell module containing cmdlets to perform 
	different calls to collect the data from the security settings of different requested 
	PI System components.

	A series of PowerShell script files (*.psm1) form a single module named PI System Audit 
	Module (or PISysAudit Module) once loaded. You will find one core script containing the 
	collection logic and four library scripts containing the validation logic for different 
	topics such as best practices to harden the machine, PI Data Archive, etc. The module exposes 
	several cmdlets either used for the internal logic or the external interface with the 
	end-user.

	The PI System Audit Module (PISysAudit) requires PowerShell version 2 and later, it can 
	be executed locally or remotely and make use of existing command line utilities to 
	perform many tasks. This allows being compatible with many versions of the PI System.

	The current version of the PISysAudit module implements 16 validations covering: 
	machine (AU1XXXX), PI Data Archive (AU2XXXX), PI AF Server (AU3XXXX) and SQL Server (AU4XXXX) 
	best practices with the PI System.

VALIDATION CHECKS AND COMPLIANCE CONDITIONS
	
		//BEGINSECTION - VALIDATIONS// This section is automatically generated.

		AU10001 - Domain Membership Check
		VALIDATION: verifies that the machine is a member of an Active Directory Domain.  
		COMPLIANCE: join the machine to an Active Directory Domain.  Use of a domain is 
		encouraged as AD provides Kerberos authentication and is our best available technology 
		for securing a PI System.  Furthermore, the implementation of transport security in the 
		PI System relies on Windows Integrated Security and AD to automatically enable higher 
		strength ciphers.

		AU10002 - Operating System Installation Type
		VALIDATION: verifies that the OS installation type is server core for the 
		reduced surface area.
		COMPLIANCE: Installation Type should be Server Core. Different SKUs are
		available at the link below:
		http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724358.aspx  
		For more on the advantages of Windows Server Core, please see:
		https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846314(v=vs.85).aspx 

		AU10003 - Firewall Enabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that the Windows host based firewall is enabled. 
		COMPLIANCE: enable the Windows firewall for Domain, Private and Public Scope.  
		A firewall's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the configuration.  
		For PI specific port requirements, please see: 
		 https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB01162  
		For more general information on the Windows firewall, see "Windows Firewall with 
		Advanced Security Overview" on TechNet: 
		https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831365(v=ws.11).aspx 

		AU10004 - AppLocker Enabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that AppLocker is enabled.   
		COMPLIANCE: set AppLocker to Enforce mode after establishing a policy and ensure that the Application Identity service is not disabled.  For a 
		primer on running AppLocker on a PI Data Archive, see: 
		https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00994

		AU10005 - UAC Enabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that UAC is enabled.  More precisely, it verifies the 
		following default features: EnableLUA, ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin, 
		EnableInstallerDetection, PromptOnSecureDesktop and EnableSecureUIAPaths.
		Additionally, a check is performed for the feature ValidateAdminCodeSignatures.  
		Lower severity is assigned if this is the only feature disabled.
		COMPLIANCE: enable the flagged UAC features through Local Security Policy.  
		For more information on specific UAC features, see: 
		https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd835564(v=ws.10).aspx 

		AU20001 - PI Data Archive Table Security Check
		VALIDATION: examines the database security of the PI Data Archive and flags any 
		ACLs that contain access for PIWorld as weak. 
		COMPLIANCE: remove PIWorld access from all database security ACLs.  Note that prior
		removing PIWorld access, you need to evaluate which applications are relying on that 
		access so that you can grant those applications access explicitly.

		AU20002 - PI Admin Usage Check
		VALIDATION: verifies that the piadmin PI User is not used in mappings or trusts.
		COMPLIANCE: replace any trusts or mappings that use piadmin with a mapping or trust to a
		PI Identity with appropriate privilege for the applications that will use it.  Will also
		check if trusts with piadmin have been disabled globally.  This can be done by checking 
		"User cannot be used in a Trust" in the Properties menu for the piadmin PI User.  To 
		access this menu open use the Idenitities, Users, & Groups plugin in PI SMT, navigate to 
		the PI User tab, right click the piadmin entry and select Properties in the context menu.  
		For more information, see "Security Best Practice" #4 in KB00833:

		AU20004 - Check Edit Days
		VALIDATION: verified that the Edit Days tuning parameter is set. 
		COMPLIANCE: set to a value greater than zero.  EditDays defines the number of past 
		days where events can be modified in the Snapshot or Archive databases. A zero value means 
		no time check is done.  For instructions to set EditDays, see "Modify the EditDays tuning 
		parameter" section in the PI Data Archive System Management Guide:

		automatically create any PI Trust entries) or 1 (create the trust entry for the loopback 
		IP address 127.0.0.1 only).

		AU20006 - Expensive Query Protection Check
		VALIDATION: verify that the PI Data Archive has protection against expensive queries. 
		COMPLIANCE: set the archive_maxqueryexecutionsec tuning parameter to a value between 60 
		and 300.  For more information on this parameter and other that can protect against expensive 
		queries, see the knowledgebase article 3224OSI8

		AU20007 - Check if the explicit login is disabled
		VALIDATION: verifies that explicit login is disabled as an authentication protocol.   
		COMPLIANCE: set the tuning parameter Server_AuthenticationPolicy to a value greater than 3.  
		This is equivalent to the third notch, "Disable explicit login", or higher on the Security 
		Settings plugin in PI SMT.  For more information, see "Security Best Practice #2" and "Security 
		Best Practice #3" in KB00833. 
		https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Troubleshooting/KB/KB00833 

		AU20008 - Check PI Server SPN
		VALIDATION: Checks PI Data Archive SPN assignment.
		COMPLIANCE: PI Data Archive SPNs exist and are assigned to the account running pinetmgr. 
		Presently only local system is supported.  Correct SPN assignment makes Kerberos 
		Authentication possible.  For more information, see "PI and Kerberos authentication" in 
		the PI Live Library. 
		https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v7/GUID-531FFEC4-9BBB-4CA0-9CE7-7434B21EA06D

		order to change the user that the service is running as, open control panel, go to Programs, 
		Programs and Features, select the entry for the PI AF Server and click Change.  This will 
		launch the installer where you will be given the option to change configuration settings, 
		including the service account.

		AU30002 - Impersonation mode for AF Data Sets Check
		VALIDATION:  verifies the impersonation mode for external data tables. 
		COMPLIANCE: set the Configuration Setting ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers to 
		false, thereby requiring impersonation for access to external tables.  This setting can be 
		changed by running the AFDiag utility with the /ExternalDataTablesAllowNonImpersonatedUsers- 
		flag.  For more information, see "AFDiag utility parameters" in the PI Live Library. 
		https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/content/en/server-v7/GUID-7092DD14-7901-4D63-8B9D-4414C569EA5F 

		AU30003 - PI AF Server Service Access Check
		VALIDATION: verifies that the PI AF application server service does not have excessive 
		rights.
